## Question 1

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The **instacart** dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables,
including:

- `order_id`: order identifier, class integer.

- `product_id`: product identifier, class integer.

- `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to cart,
  class integer.

- `reordered`: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the
  past, 0 otherwise, class integer.

- `user_id`: customer identifier, class integer.

- `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the
  data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set),
  class character.

- `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
  n=nth), class integer.

- `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed, class
  integer.

- `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was
  placed, class integer.

- `days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA
  if order_number=1, class integer.

- `product_name`: name of the product, class character.

- `aisle_id`: aisle identifier, class integer.

- `department_id`: department identifier, class integer.

- `aisle`: the name of the aisle, class character.

- `department`: the name of the department, class character.

There are 131209 unique users and 131209 unique orders. On average,
there are 1.9780243^{5} items sold per day. There are 134 aisles and 21
departments. Below are some graphs to help visualize the dataset key
variables.

- How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
  from?

  - Answer: There are 134 aisles, and most items are ordered from aisle
    *fresh vegetables*.

- Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
  limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
  aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

- Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
  aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
  fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
  table.

- Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
  Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
  format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
