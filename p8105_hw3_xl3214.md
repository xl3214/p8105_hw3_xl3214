## Question 1

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The **instacart** dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables,
including:

- `order_id`: order identifier

- `product_id`: product identifier

- `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to cart

- `reordered`: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the
  past, 0 otherwise

- `user_id`: customer identifier

- `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the
  data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set)

- `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
  n=nth)

- `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed

- `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was placed

- `days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA
  if order_number=1

- `product_name`: name of the product

- `aisle_id`: aisle identifier

- `department_id`: department identifier

- `aisle`: the name of the aisle

- `department`: the name of the department

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

``` r
#instacart |> 
# ggplot(aes(x = product_id, color = aisle_id)) + geom_histogram() + 
# labs(
#   title = "Product Histogram",
#   x = "Product Unique ID",
#   y = "Number of Items (Count)"
# )
 
# group_by(order_id) |>
# summarize(n_obs = n()) |> 
# ggplot(aes(x = add_to_cart_order)) + 
# geom_histogram() |>
# ggplot(aes(x = add_to_cart_order, y = tmax)) + 
# geom_point()
```

- How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
  from?
- Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
  limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
  aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.
- Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
  aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
  fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
  table.
- Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
  Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
  format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
